Your personal medical assistant.

This is my second year android laboratory project. It is a simple CRUD app which measures peoples's BMI, BMR, gives them health tips and keeps track of their diet and exercise. One can also get immergency health concerning updates like: Ambulance number or numbers of nearby hospitals from this app.
